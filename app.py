Home remedies include apple cider vinegar spray, aloe vera, coconut oil, and oatmeal baths. Treatment involves flea control medications, antihistamines, medicated shampoos, and antibiotics if needed. Prevent fleas with regular grooming, cleaning, and flea preventatives.",
    "Hotspot": "Hotspots develop from allergies or moisture buildup, presenting as inflamed, oozing sores. Chamomile tea compress, betadine, and aloe vera provide relief, while treatment includes trimming fur, antiseptics, antibiotics, and E-collars to prevent licking. Keep the skin dry and address allergies to prevent hotspots.",
    "Mange": "Mange, caused by mites, leads to intense itching and hair loss. Remedies like neem oil, coconut oil, and yogurt help, but vet-prescribed ivermectin, medicated shampoos, and antibiotics may be necessary. Prevent mange with hygiene and immune-boosting diets.",
